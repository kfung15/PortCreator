# PortCreator
Let the classroom come to life. Financial economics gone wild.

Ok so here is how to use this thing.
1. For a quick and easy demo, download all three file and put them in the same folder.
2. Download the latest version of R (3.6.2 at the time of writing this)
3. Download RStudio
4. Open RStudio
5. Open PortAnalysis2 in RStudio
6. Ctrl-F (or Command-F for Mac users) and search for CHANGE. This will lead you to the parameter that you can adjust.
7. After you are done with adjustments, Ctrl-A all the code and hit Run.
8. At the end of it all, a portfolio will pop up in the folder that you created in step 1.

If for some reason something doesn't work, check your internet connection first.
If something is still broken, please send me a message on Issues. 
I'll get back to you ASAP.
